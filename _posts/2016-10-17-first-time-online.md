Finally!

After quite some time, I finally managed to get the first parts ready to be put
online. It is far from complete, and here is the current status:

- [Home]({{site.baseurl}}/): *done*
- [Quick Start Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/qsg): *done*
- [Gear]({{site.baseurl}}/gear): *empty*
- [Pumping Techniques]({{site.baseurl}}/techniques): *empty*
- [FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/faq): *done*
- [Links]({{site.baseurl}}/links): *done*
- [About]({{site.baseurl}}/about): *done*

The idea behind putting this online as is is that some of the questions I've
been answering on reddit could have included a link to the Quick Start Guide or
the FAQ, and I feel like it can already be useful like this. If people do find
it useful it will probably help me getting the motivation to work on the
missing parts too.

Hope you'll find it interesting and useful, cheers!
