## About the site

This site is meant to share *my* knowledge of LDP, and give advices *I* feel are
the best.

I'll try to have the basics built in the website, with a few articles that gives
idea of how to setup your gear, how to pump, answering a small FAQ I'll build
over time so people wondering how to get started can easily find answers.

**DISCLAIMER**: I'm not saying I know everything, or that everything I say is
the only way to do stuff. Longboarding in general, and especially LDP is a
matter of taste, each person has a right to choose, and something that works
fine for someone can seems wrong to another person.

## Why this site

As mentionned in the [links](/links/) page,
[r/longboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/) is getting more and
more interest in LDP lately, but given the most *read* part of this sub is the
Daily General Thread, questions get asked again and again. That plus discord, I
felt like I was repeating myself with information I already type quite often
since I started LDP, so I decided it was probably time to create this sharing
what I feel was worth it

## About me

I was born in 1982, I'm a software engineer, married, living in Versailles
(France).

I skated a little when I was a kid, like 6 or 7 years old, then about 16 I
think, I trial biked, then BMX, then street skated, then more BMX, and finally
switched to computer stuff, and stopped most of the sports.

I started longboarding in 2014, first cruising around, then I tried my hand at
dancing, sawing videos of people crossstepping and felt they were actually
gaining speed, I searched about and discovered pumping and never stopped since
then. Tried a bit of freeriding but I'm too much of a coward to go fast enough
or commit to slides...
