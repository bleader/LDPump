This page is meant to simply be a quick introduction to let people get started
without spending hours reading about all the fine tuning and settings. Some
things will be overlooked or over simplify, bear with it, if you read this I
assume you want the quick and simple stuff, even if it is a bit less accurate.

# What is pumping

Pumping is a way to propel yourself on a skateboard without pushing, or at least
pushing less often. You turn left to right almost continuously and that makes
you go forward.

There is a more in depth explanation in the
[Techniques]({{site.baseurl}}/techniques/) page.

# Why pumping

It is not necesserally more efficient or faster than other techniques
(i.e: pushing, paddling), but it feels to me it is the most surfy, fun and
enjoyable way to skate. It's up to you to make your own mind.

# What you need

*NOTE: For this quick guide, I'll assume you want to try pumping with
parts you have laying around, if you're in buisness to buy gear for
pumping, I suggest you dig deeper and have a look at the
[Gear]({{site.baseurl}}/gear/) page,
that will give you a better view and will likely avoid doing some wrong
choices.*

About anything can be pumped, but efficiency can always be improved, and the
better the efficiency of your setup the longer you'll be able to go without
pushing or getting too tired.

It is worth mentionning that hanger width + wheelbase length will work like
bike gears, any of the two becoming smaller makes it *easier* to pump, and will
reduce top speed, where wider trucks and longer wheelbase will require higher
speed to start pumping but will allow an higher top speed.

## Main idea

- Front: Turny, Soft bushings, High angle
- Back: Stable, Harder bushings, Lower angle
- Deck: Can be topmounted with wedges 

## Parts

- trucks: ideally not too wide, but generally most people will have 180mm or
  165mm laying around
  * Most common are 5" / 125-129mm
  * Some people use 6" / 152mm
  * Some spaceable can be configured inbetween
  * High angle trucks like paris or randal sitting at 50° are generally good
    for a testing setup
- deck: something that can be topmounted with wedges, if you have large trucks
  better go with no too long wheelbase, these are just suggestions for a first
  *tryout build*
  * 180mm hanger: 24" wheelbase
  * 165mm hanger: 26" wheelbase
  * Below 165mm aim at 28" or longer wheelbase
- Wedges:
  * Generally front sits between 55 and 60°, sometimes more, but that's less
    common
  * Back is ofter as close to 0 as possible, higher angles will work, but will
    probably provide less power from the back, which isn't a real issue,
    especially if you're just looking for a quick test
- Hardware:
  * long bolts to get through those wedges 2 or 2.5" depending on how much
    wedges you plan to use
  * washers for bolts: especially if you're top mounting a dropthrough, get
    some small washer to spread a bit the pressure from the bolt heads
  * washers: you generally want smooth motion, so it is common to use flat
    everywhere, if you can't flip a cupped one roadside, at lest for the front
    truck
- Wheels:
  * big: bigger wheels will get you over cracks and stuff more easily
  * grippy: once you'll know how to pump and get the movement right, you'll
    apply quite some force on the side of your back wheels, better have something
    that grip enough
  * soft: for grip, and for confort once you start doing "longer" run, but
    that's when you get the basics down
- Footstop
  * Not mandatory, but the pumping movement will likely get you sliding
    forward, it generally is helpful to have some kind of footstop

## Build

To try to sum up:

- get your deck
- put wedges with the thin part toward front of the board, that will increase
  angle for your front truck, and decrease for the back truck (yes, for both tkp
  and rkp)
- mount one of your turny truck front, with softer bushing that you would
  normally use
- mount a truck (a less turny one if you have any) in the back with harder
  bushing, same as freeride/downhill or a bit harder will be fine.

# How to pump

To get you started, I'll just talk about the *starting up* technique that I'll
call the *front wiggles*
- Get a few good push (no need to go full downhill race start push either)
- Get a pretty forward stance: both feet should be on the first front half of
  the board
- Use your front ankle to make the board turn, make it go smoothly from left to
  right

And that's it really for starters that should be sufficient, generally while you
get the grasp of it, you'll encounter the following:

1. Not much effect
2. Keep momentum a bit longer
3. Keep momentun for something that feels really long
4. Build up momentum

That technique is not the most efficient for longer distance: it get your front
leg tired pretty quickly and ask a lot of effort simply to keep going, but have
a good power, so it is good for starting or building up speed.

If you've managed to get there, time to go deeper and look at other
[techniques](techniques/).

# A few tips

1. If you don't have sharped lips wheels, you can try your rounded lips wheels
   and flip them
2. If you want to get a narrower ride, you can use offset or sideset wheels
   flipped. Potentially only the front ones, to keep the grip from the lips in
   the back
3. flip cupped washer if you lack flat washers (roadside only obviously)
4. Try softer bushing boardside to make turning easier

# Conclusion

Hope this was both *quick* and *clear* enough to get you started quickly.
