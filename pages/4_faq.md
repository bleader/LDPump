### How long can you keep going?

Short answer: Forever.

Long answer: It will depend of the efficiency of your setup, if you have flat
ground with decent pavement where there is no need to stop, and how *in shape*
you are. Because even if going easy and not pushing yourself too hard is fairly
easy to keep going, it still ask effort on your part, and you body and
muscle will be the limit. This also reach the same conclusion as the short
answer, if nothing make you stop and your setup is efficient, the only limit is
when you'll be exhausted.

### Can you go uphill?

Short answer: Yes.

Long Answer: It can be really hard and leave you totally worn out, it can
actually be harder than pushing, it probably can't go on as steep hills as
pushing would, and can on steeper hills be real slow, but it is pretty doable,
and can be very satisfying. In case you're trying to break you own distance or
time record, or in a race, it is strongly advised not to try to hard, you'll
make your heart race, and exhaust yourself real quick.

### How fast can you go?

There is no short answer for this one, it will depend of your setup: wider
hanger, longer wheelbase will lead to more push, but generally to a higher top
speed.

I would say that with a good setup, on flat ground and really putting
everything you have in a *sprint*, you can reach about 30km/h (19mph), maybe a
bit more.

For me, with my current setup I generally tops about 27km/h (16.7mph).

**TODO**: test and update values, add video

### What average can I expect?

It all depends, main factors are:

- Your setup
- How fit are you
- Pavement quality on your run
- How often do you have to stop

On [endomondo](https://www.endomondo.com/) some people average about 20km/h
(12.43mph). In good conditions if I don't have to stop or slow down, I can
average 15-16km/h (9-10mph) anything above will kill me in no time. In city,
with cars, pedestrian, crossings and nobody caring about anything else than
themselves, I generally get stuck at about 13-14km/h (8-8.7mph).

That is generally enough to take over most of the people commuting by bike, and
that's oddly satisfying. Of course, I'm not talking about real cyclists or any
sporty riders.

### How do yo stop or slow down?

There isn't much you can do and it boils down to the same as other longboard
disciplines:

- footbrake: [Search youtube for tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=footbrake%20longboard&search=Search)
- jump off (if not going too fast)
- checks: generally mini checks, and that isn't advised as it will wear your
  wheels and make then a little bit less grippy... I still love to mini check
  my LDP setup.
- carving: simply turn pretty sharply left and right, kinda the same as the
  pumping motion, but there you want you back foot to be pretty far back to
  weight on the back truck, dead back + long wheelbase tends to make the back
  drifty. The idea is to get a part of the force of the forward movement toward
  the side of the wheels, thus slowing you down. It is a good thing to practice
  it on mellow hills with nobody to get the hang of it.

### How does it work?

There are a lot of things that comes into play:
- snake boards, ripstick, carver cruisers works mosly through the zigzag
  motion, that is a part of it
- the back truck trying to catch up, and its bushings putting the board back in
  place
- the torsional flex of the board, for the same reason as the back bushings

To make it simple, the back trying to follow the front helped by the force your
feet will put on the board will make the board go forward.
