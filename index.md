## Welcome to *LDPump*

This website is meant to try to answer most common questions about longboard pumping, and helping people getting started both with the way to pump and setting up their gear.

This homepage will list various *news* and *articles*, and the basics informations are available on the top right in the various sections.

Hope it will be useful to at least a few people!
